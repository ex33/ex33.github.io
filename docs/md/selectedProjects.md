        <div class="project-description"> <strong>Part 1 of building a quadcopter from "scratch". </strong> <br> 
        As with all GNC systems, adequate modeling and simulation of its component is necessary for tuning its algorithm, hardware selection, and a first pass at validation through analyses such as Monte-Carlo. This project contains details on a simulation built in MATLAB featuring sensor / motor models, state estimation, and closed loop control of the position, velocity, attitude (quaternion), and body rates.</div>
